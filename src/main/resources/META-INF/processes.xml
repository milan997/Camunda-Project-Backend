<!-- A single deployment (process-archive) is declared. The process archive has the name 
	loan-approval and is deployed to the process engine with the name default. 
	Two additional properties are specified: -->
<!--     isDeleteUponUndeploy: this property controls whether the undeployment of the 
									process application should entail that the process engine deployment is deleted from the database. 
									The default setting is false. If this property is set to true, undeployment of the process application 
									leads to the removal of the deployment (including process instances) from the database. -->
<!--     isScanForProcessDefinitions: if this property is set to true, the classpath of the
								    process application is automatically scanned for deployable resources. Deployable resources
									must end in .bpmn20.xml, .bpmn, .cmmn11.xml, .cmmn, .dmn11.xml or .dmn. -->
